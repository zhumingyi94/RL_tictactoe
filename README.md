## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes. For deployment on a live system, please refer to the deployment section.

### Running the Project

To run the algorithms and experiment with different configurations, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py +algorithm=<algorithm_name> +config=<config_file>
For example, to run SARSA with a specific configuration:

python main.py +algorithm=SARSA +config=sarsa_config.yaml

Hydra will manage all configurations and logging automatically, making it easier to experiment with different setups. After running the algorithms, refer to the .ipynb files in the /experiments directory to view and analyze the results.
